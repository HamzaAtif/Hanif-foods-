# Image Fixes for Hanif Foods & Caterers

## Current Issues
- Many menu items are using the same images repeatedly
- This creates a poor user experience with repeated visuals
- Images should be unique and representative of each specific dish

## BBQ Section - Current repeated images:
- seekh-kebab.jpg is used by multiple tikka items
- mixed-grill.jpg is used by multiple boti items

## Curries Section - Current repeated images:
- butter-chicken.jpg used by multiple qorma and handi dishes
- lamb-karahi.jpg used by multiple karahi dishes
- dal-makhani.jpg used by multiple stew/qeema dishes

## Fry Section - Current repeated images:
- chicken-tikka.jpg used by multiple chicken fry items

## Dessert Bar Section - Current repeated images:

## Refreshments Section - Current repeated images:

## Solution
Each menu item should have its own unique image file that represents that specific dish. This will improve the visual experience and help customers better identify what they want to order.
